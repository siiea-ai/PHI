# PHI-Based Model Training: Complete A-Z Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for training AI models using golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) principles throughout the entire training pipeline. The approach extends beyond PHI-based architecture design to include φ-proportioned learning rates, batch sizes, training phases, data sampling, and regularization.

## Core Philosophy

**Harmonious Training**: Every aspect of training follows golden ratio proportions, creating a natural, fractal-like training process that mirrors patterns found in nature and consciousness.

## PHASE 1: Theoretical Foundation & Design
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Establish theoretical framework and design PHI training algorithms

### 1.1 Research & Analysis
- **PHI Learning Rate Theory**: Research optimal φ-based learning rate schedules
  - φ-decay: `lr * φ^(-epoch/total_epochs)`
  - φ-warmup: `lr * (1 - φ^(-step/warmup_steps))`
  - φ-cosine: Cosine annealing with φ-proportioned cycles

- **PHI Batch Size Theory**: Design φ-based batch progression
  - Start: `base_batch_size`
  - Scale: `batch_size * φ^(phase)`
  - Memory constraints vs φ principles balance

- **PHI Training Phases**: Structure training in φ proportions
  - Phase 1: 38.2% of total epochs (1/φ²)
  - Phase 2: 61.8% of total epochs (1/φ)
  - Different objectives per phase

def phi_learning_rate(base_lr, epoch, total_epochs, mode='decay'):
    if mode == 'decay':
        return base_lr * (PHI ** (-(epoch / total_epochs)))
    elif mode == 'warmup':
        return base_lr * (1 - (PHI ** (-(epoch / warmup_epochs))))
    elif mode == 'cosine_phi':
        return base_lr * (1 + cos(pi * epoch / total_epochs)) / 2 * INV_PHI

def phi_batch_size(base_batch, phase, max_batch=None):
    new_batch = int(base_batch * (PHI ** phase))
    return min(new_batch, max_batch) if max_batch else new_batch

def phi_training_phases(total_epochs):
    phase1_epochs = int(total_epochs * INV_PHI_SQUARED)  # 38.2%
    phase2_epochs = total_epochs - phase1_epochs         # 61.8%
